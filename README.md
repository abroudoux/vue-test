# Vue Test

This project is the digest of a work week where I had to : 
- make a website (4 or 5 pages, content was not important) using Vue or React
- this website should be developed using Typescript

## Graphic support 

With their permission, I used the image and the name of ‘Krakn Behavourial’ where I’m currently interning.
